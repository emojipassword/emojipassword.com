Despite the best efforts of [Google](https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/23/google-plans-to-bring-password-free-logins-to-android-apps-by-year-end/), [Microsoft](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE2KEup) and [countless](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/13/halifax-trials-heartbeat-id-technology-for-online-banking) [startups](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/is-it-time-to-replace-passwords-with-passthoughts/), the password is here for the foreseeable future. While passwords are still with us, we should work to strengthen password-based authentication. We can address the problem in part by requiring an additional factor for authentication (like a key fob or an authenticator app). We can address the problem directly with password strength policies. The problem can be addressed through user education and advocacy, like encouraging the use of password managers.   

When using passwords it is recommended to draw from a broader set of characters. All other things being equal, a password composed of only lowercase letters is far weaker than a password composed of upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters.


## Question
Why not take it a step further and include emoji?

**What percentage of popular websites allow emoji in passwords?**

## Scope
A password is not the same as a passphrase.

A password is not the same as a passcode.

## Experiment
Since April 2018, I have started keeping track of support for emoji in passwords on various websites. For each site tested, the following questions are answered:

  * What is the current date?
  * When registering for the site, is a password comprised completely of emoji permitted?
  * If not, is a password comprised partially of emoji permitted?
  * How do emoji impact password strength meters on sites that have them?
